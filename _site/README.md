☁️🔐 Cloud & Security Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases a collection of cloud infrastructure, DevOps, and cybersecurity projects I’ve built to demonstrate hands-on skills in designing, securing, and operating modern systems.

The projects here focus on real-world scenarios: scalable cloud architectures, secure configurations, threat detection, automation, and security best practices.

🧭 What You’ll Find Here

This portfolio is split into two main areas:

☁️ Cloud Projects

Projects focused on cloud platforms, infrastructure, and automation, including:

Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Cloud networking and architecture

CI/CD pipelines

Monitoring and logging

Cost optimization and scalability

Technologies commonly used:

AWS / Azure / GCP

Terraform / CloudFormation

Docker & Kubernetes

GitHub Actions / CI-CD tools

🔐 Security Projects

Projects centered on securing systems, identifying vulnerabilities, and responding to threats:

Cloud security hardening

Identity & Access Management (IAM)

Network security

Vulnerability assessment & remediation

Logging, monitoring, and incident detection

Security concepts & tools include:

IAM & least-privilege design

Security monitoring & alerting

Vulnerability scanning

Threat modeling

Secure configuration & compliance
